This project is at the interface of machine learning and security. Machine learning (ML) is the set of algorithms that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience. The ML algorithms can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations of data and looks for patterns in the data in order to make better decisions or predictions in the future.

Applications of ML in a domain usually have the following steps:

1. Gathering data,
2. Data preparation,
3. Choosing a model,
4. Training the model to obtain its parameters,
5. Evaluation,
6. Hyper-parameter tuning,
7. Prediction.

Note that an ML model has two set of parameters. The first set is selected by the user and is called the hyper-parameters. The second set is obtained in the training phase.
